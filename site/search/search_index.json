Context Statements Machine Instructions Contexts & Threads The Harmony VM Harmony Language Details The Harmony language borrows heavily from Python. However, there are some important differences that we will describe below. Harmony is not object-oriented Python is object-oriented, but Harmony is not. This can lead to some unexpected differences. For example, consider the following code: x = y = [ 1, 2 ] x[0] = 3 assert y[0] == 1 In Python, lists are objects. Thus x and y point to the same list, and the assertion would fail if executed by Python. In Harmony, lists are values. So when x is updated in Line 2, it does not affect the value of y . The assertion succeeds. Harmony supports references to values, allowing programs to implement shared objects. Because Harmony does not have objects, it also does not have object methods. However, Harmony methods and lambdas are program counter constants. These constants can be added to dictionaries. For example, in PetersonMethod.hny you can add the P enter and P exit methods to the { .turn: 0, .flags: [ False, False ], .enter: P_enter, .exit: P_exit } That would allow you to simulate object methods. There are at least two reasons why Harmony is not object-oriented. First, object-orientation often adds layers of indirection that would make it harder to model check and also to interpret the results. Consider, for example, a lock. In Python, a lock is an object. A lock variable would contain a reference to a lock object. In Harmony, a lock variable contains the value of the lock itself. Thus, the following statement means something quite different in Python and Harmony: x = y = Lock(); In Python, this creates two variables x and y referring to the same lock. In Harmony, the two variables will be two different locks. If you want two variables referring to the same lock in Harmony, you would write: x = y = malloc(Lock()); The second reason for Harmony not being object-oriented is that many concurrency solutions in the literature are expressed in C or some other low-level language that does not support objectorientation, but instead use malloc and free. Constants, Global and Local Variables Each (non-reserved) identifier in a Harmony program refers to either a constant, a global variable, or a local variable. Constants are declared using const statements. Those constants are computed at compile-time. Local variables all declared. They can be declared in def statements (i.e., arguments), let statements, and in for loops. Also, each method has an implicitly declared result variable. Local variables are tightly scoped and cannot be shared between threads. While in theory one method can be declared within another, they cannot share variables either. All other variables are global and must be initialized before any threads are spawned. While arguments to a method and variables in for loops can be modified, we discourage it for improved code readability. Operator Precedence In Harmony, there is no syntactic difference between applying an argument to a function or an index to a dictionary. Both use the syntax a b c ... . We call this application , and application is left-associative. So a b c is interpreted as ( a b ) c : b is applied to a , and then c is applied to the result. For readability, it may help to write a ( b ) for function application and a [ b ] for indexing. In case b is an atom, you can also write a.b for indexing. There are three classes of precedence. Application has the highest precedence. So ! a b is interpreted as !( a b ) and a b + c d is interpreted as ( a b ) + ( c d ). Unary operators have the next highest precedence, and the remaining operators have the lowest precedence. So -2 + 3 evaluates to 1, not -5. Associative operators (+, \u2217, |, &, \u02c6, and , or ) are interpreted as general n -ary operators, and you are allowed to write a + b + c . However, a - b - c is illegal, as is any combination of operators with an arity larger than one, such as a + b < c . In such cases you have to add parentheses or brackets to indicate what the intended evaluation order is, such as ( a + b ) < c . In almost all expressions, subexpressions are evaluated left to right. So a [ b ] + c first evaluates a , then b (and then applies b to a ), and then c . The one exception is the expression a if c else b , where c is evaluated first. In that expression, only a or b is evaluated depending on the value of c . In the expression a and b and ... , evaluation is left to right but stops once one of the subexpressions evaluates to False . Similarly for or , where evaluation stops once one of the subexpressions evaluates to True. A sequence of comparison operations, such as a < b < c , is evaluated left to right but stops as soon as one of the comparisons fails. As an aside: the expression a not in b is equivalent to not ( a in b ). Harmony generalizes this construct for any pair of a unary (except '-') and a binary operator. In particular, a not and b is the same as not ( a and b ). For those familiar with logic gates, not and is the equivalent of NAND. Similarly, not = > is non-implication. Tuples, Lists, and Pattern Matching Harmony's tuples and, equivalently, lists, are just special cases of dictionaries. They can be bracketed either by '(' and ')' or by '[' and ']', but the brackets are often optional. Importantly, with a singleton list, the one element must be followed by a comma. So the statement x = 1,; assigns a singleton tuple (or list) to x . Because tuples and lists are dictionaries, the del statement is different from Python. For example, if x = [.a, .b, .c], then del x [1] results in x = { 0:.a, 2:.c }, not x = [.a, .c]. Harmony also does not support special slicing syntax like Python. To modify lists, use the subseq method in the list module . Harmony allows pattern matching against nested tuples in various language constructs. The following are the same in Python and Harmony: x, = 1,: assigns 1 to x ; x , y = 1, (2, 3): assigns 1 to x and (2, 3) to y ; x , ( y , z ) = 1, (2, 3): assigns 1 to x , 2 to y , and 3 to z ; x , ( y , z ) = 1, 2; generates an runtime error because 2 cannot be matched with ( y , z ); x [0], x [1] = x [1], x [0]; swaps the first two elements of list x . As in Python, pattern matching can also be used in for statements. For example: for key, value in [ (1, 2), (3, 4) ]: ... Harmony (but not Python) also allows pattern matching in defining and invoking methods. For example, you can write: def f[a, (b, c)]: ... and then call f[1, (2, 3)]. Note that the more familiar: def g( a ) defines a method g with a single argument a . Invoking g(1, 2) would assign the tuple (1, 2) to a . This is not consistent with Python syntax. For single argument methods, you may want to declare as follows: def g( a, ). Calling g(1,) assigns 1 to a , while calling g(1, 2) would result in a runtime error as (1, 2) cannot be matched with ( a ,). Pattern matching can also be used in const and let statements. from stack import Stack, push, pop teststack = Stack() push(?teststack, 1) push(?teststack, 2) v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 2 push(?teststack, 3) v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 3 v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 1 Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! For Loops and Comprehensions While Harmony does not support general iterators such as Python does, Harmony allows iterating over sets and dictionaries (and thus lists and tuples). The details are a little different from Python: When iterating over a set, the set is always traversed in order ; In case of a dictionary, the iteration is over the values of the dictionary, but in the order of the keys. In the case of lists, this works much the same as in Python, but in the case of general dictionaries, Python iterates over the keys rather than the values; If you want to iterate over the keys of a dictionary d , use for k inkeys d ; The list module provides methods values(), items(), enumerate(), and reversed() for other types of iteration supported by Python. Harmony supports nesting and filtering in for loops. For example: for i in { 1..10 } for j in { 1..10 } where i < j: ... Harmony also supports set, list, and dictionary comprehensions. Comprehensions are similar to Python, except that filtering uses the keyword where instead of if. Dynamic Allocation Harmony supports various options for dynamic allocation. By way of example, consider a stack. The code below presents a test program for a stack. We present four different stack implementations to illustrate options for dynamic allocation: from stack import Stack, push, pop teststack = Stack() push(?teststack, 1) push(?teststack, 2) v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 2 push(?teststack, 3) v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 3 v = pop(?teststack) assert v == 1 Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! Dynamically Updated List The code below uses a single list to represent the stack. It is updated to perform push and pop operations. def Stack(): result = [ ] def push(st, v): (!st)[len(!st)] = v def pop(st): let n = len(!st) \u2013 1: result = (!st)[n] del (!st)[n] Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! Static List The code below also uses a list but, instead of updating the list, it replaces the list with a new one for each operation. import list def Stack(): result = [] def push(st, v): !st += [v,] def pop(st): let n = len(!st) - 1: result = (!st)[n] !st = list.subseq(!st, 0, n) Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! Recursive Tuple The code below represents a stack as a recursively nested tuple ( v,f ), where v is the element on top of the stack and r is a stack that is the remainder. def Stack(): result = () def push(st, v): (!st) = (v, !st) def pop(st): let (top, rest) = !st: result = top !st = rest Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! Linked List The code below implements a stack as a linked list with nodes allocated using the alloc module. from alloc import malloc, free def Stack(): result = None def push(st, v): !st = malloc({ .value: v, .rest: !st }) def pop(st): let node = !st: result = node->value !st = node->rest free(node) Try out the stack implementation above in the IDE! While the last option is the most versatile (it allows cyclic data structures), Harmony does not support garbage collection for memory allocated this way and so allocated memory that is no longer in use must be explicitly released using free.

However, there are some important differences that we will describe below.","title":"Harmony Language Details"},{"location":"reference/language/overview/#harmony-is-not-object-oriented","text":"Python is object-oriented, but Harmony is not. This can lead to some unexpected differences. For example, consider the following code: x = y = [ 1, 2 ] x[0] = 3 assert y[0] == 1 In Python, lists are objects. Thus x and y point to the same list, and the assertion would fail if executed by Python. In Harmony, lists are values. So when x is updated in Line 2, it does not affect the value of y . The assertion succeeds. Harmony supports references to values, allowing programs to implement shared objects. Because Harmony does not have objects, it also does not have object methods. However, Harmony methods and lambdas are program counter constants. These constants can be added to dictionaries. For example, in PetersonMethod.hny you can add the P enter and P exit methods to the { .turn: 0, .flags: [ False, False ], .enter: P_enter, .exit: P_exit } That would allow you to simulate object methods. There are at least two reasons why Harmony is not object-oriented. First, object-orientation often adds layers of indirection that would make it harder to model check and also to interpret the results. Consider, for example, a lock. In Python, a lock is an object. A lock variable would contain a reference to a lock object. In Harmony, a lock variable contains the value of the lock itself. Thus, the following statement means something quite different in Python and Harmony: x = y = Lock(); In Python, this creates two variables x and y referring to the same lock. In Harmony, the two variables will be two different locks. If you want two variables referring to the same lock in Harmony, you would write: x = y = malloc(Lock()); The second reason for Harmony not being object-oriented is that many concurrency solutions in the literature are expressed in C or some other low-level language that does not support objectorientation, but instead use malloc and free.","title":"Harmony is not object-oriented"},{"location":"reference/language/overview/#constants-global-and-local-variables","text":"Each (non-reserved) identifier in a Harmony program refers to either a constant, a global variable, or a local variable.

Local variables are tightly scoped and cannot be shared between threads. While in theory one method can be declared within another, they cannot share variables either. All other variables are global and must be initialized before any threads are spawned.

Both use the syntax a b c ... . We call this application , and application is left-associative. So a b c is interpreted as ( a b ) c : b is applied to a , and then c is applied to the result. For readability, it may help to write a ( b ) for function application and a [ b ] for indexing. In case b is an atom, you can also write a.b for indexing. There are three classes of precedence. Application has the highest precedence. So ! a b is interpreted as !( a b ) and a b + c d is interpreted as ( a b ) + ( c d ). Unary operators have the next highest precedence, and the remaining operators have the lowest precedence. So -2 + 3 evaluates to 1, not -5. Associative operators (+, \u2217, |, &, \u02c6, and , or ) are interpreted as general n -ary operators, and you are allowed to write a + b + c . However, a - b - c is illegal, as is any combination of operators with an arity larger than one, such as a + b < c . In such cases you have to add parentheses or brackets to indicate what the intended evaluation order is, such as ( a + b ) < c . In almost all expressions, subexpressions are evaluated left to right. So a [ b ] + c first evaluates a , then b (and then applies b to a ), and then c . The one exception is the expression a if c else b , where c is evaluated first.

Below is a complete list of Harmony value types with examples: Type Example Boolean False,True Integer -inf, ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., inf Atom .example,.test1,.0x4A Program Counter (method names are program counter constants) Dictionary {.account: 12345, .valid: False } Set {1, 2, 3},{ False, .id, 3} Address ?lock, ?flags[2], None Context (generated bystopexpression) Tuples, lists, strings, and bags are all special cases of dictionaries. Both tuples and lists map indexes (starting at 0) to Harmony values. Their format is either (e,e, ...,e,) or [e,e, ..., e,] . If the tuple or list has two or more elements, then the final comma is optional. A string is represented as a tuple of its characters. Characters are one-character atoms, which can be expressed in hexadecimal unicode using the syntax .0xXX . A bag or multiset is a dictionary that maps a value to how many times it occurs in the bag. All Harmony values are ordered with respect to one another. First they are ordered by type according to the table above. So, for example, True < 0 < .xyz < { 0 }) . Within types, the following rules apply: False < True ; integers are ordered in the natural way; atoms are lexicographically ordered; program counters are ordered by their integer values; dictionaries are first converted into a list of ordered (key, value) pairs. Then two dictionaries are lexicographically ordered by this representation; a set is first converted into an ordered list, then lexicographically ordered; an address is a list of atoms. None is the empty list of atoms. Addresses are lexicographically ordered accordingly; contexts (Appendix E) are ordered first by name, then by program counter, then by the remaining content. Generic operators on Harmony values include: e == e equivalence e != e inequivalence e < e, e <= e, e > e, e >= e comparison 1.1 Boolean The Boolean type has only two possible values: False and True . Unlike in Python, in Harmony booleans are distinct from integers, and in particular False < 0 . In statements and expressions where booleans are expected, it is not possible to substibute values of other types. Operations on booleans include: e and e and ... conjuction e or e or ... disjunction e => e, e not => e implication not e negation v if e else v\u2032 v or v\u2032 depending one anys, alls disjunction / conjunction for set or lists 1.2 Integer The integer type supports any whole number, as well as \u2212inf and inf . In the Python-based model checker, integers are infinite precision. In the C-based model checker, integers are implemented by two\u2019s complement 61-bit words, and \u2212inf is represented by the minimal integer and inf is represented by the maximal integer. Operations on integers include: -e negation abs(e) absolute value e + e + ... sum e - e difference e * e * e ... product e / e, e // e integer division e % e, e mod e integer division remainder e ** e power ~e binary inversion e & e & ... binary and e \\| e \\| ... binary or e ^ e ^ ... binary exclusive or e << e binary shift left e >> e binary shift right {e..e\u2032} set of integers from e to e\u2032 inclusive 1.3 Atom Atoms are essentially names and consist of one or more unicode characters. If they do not contain special characters and do not start with a digit, then an atom can be represented by a \u201c.\u201d followed by the characters. For example, .hello is a representation of the atom \u201chello\u201d. A special character can be represented by .0xXX , where XX is the hexidecimal unicode for the character. Atoms should not be confused with strings. There are no special operations on atoms. (In the future, operators may be introduced that convert between strings and atoms.) 1.4 Set In Harmony you can create a set of any collection of Harmony values. Its syntax is { v 0 , v 1 , ... }. Python users: note that in Harmony the empty set is denoted as {} . The set module (Section C.5) contains various convenient routines that operate on sets. Native operations on sets include: lens cardinality s - s set difference s & s & ... intersection s \\| s \\| ... union s ^ s ^ ... inclusion/exclusion (elements in odd number of sets) choose s select an element (Harmony will try all) mins minimum element maxs maximum element anys True if any value is True alls True if all values are True Harmony also supports set comprehension. In its simplest form, { f(v) for v in s } returns a set that is constructed by applying f to all elements in s (where s is a set or a list). This is known as mapping. But set comprehension is much more powerful and can include joining multiple sets (using nested for loops) and filtering (using the where keyword). For example: { x + y for x in s for y in s such that (x * y ) == 4 } returns a set that is constructed by summing pairs of elements from s that, when multiplied, have the value 4 . 1.5 Dictionary A dictionary maps a set of values (known as keys ) to another set of values. The generic syntax of a dictionary is { k 0 : v 0 , k 1 : v 1 , ... }. Different from Python, the empty dictionary is either () or [] (because {} is the empty set in Harmony). If there are duplicate keys in the list, then only the one with the maximum value survives. Therefore the order of the keys in the dictionary does not matter. Dictionaries support comprehension. The basic form is: { f(k) : g(k) fork in s }. There are various special cases of dictionaries, including lists, tuples, strings, and bags (multi-sets) that are individually described below. Operations on dictionaries include the following: d k indexing len d the number of keys in d keys d the set of keys in d v [not] in keys d check if v is a key in d v [not] in d check if v is a value in d min d the minimum value in d max d the maximum value in d any d True if any value is True all d True if all values are True d & d & ... dictionary intersection d \\| d \\| ... dictionary union Because in Harmony brackets are used for parsing purposes only, you can write d[k] (or d(k) ) instead of d k . However, if k is an atom, like .id , then you might prefer the notation k.id . Python users beware: the Harmony v in d operator checks if there is some key k such that d[k] = v . In Python, the same syntax checks if v is a key in d . The difference exists because in Harmony a list is a special case of a dictionary. Dictionary intersection and dictionary union are defined so that they work well with bags. With disjoint dictionaries, intersection and union work as expected. If there is a key in the intersection, then dictionary intersection retains the minimum value while dictionary union retains the maximum value. Unlike Python, Harmony dictionary intersection and union are commutative and associative. 1.6 List or Tuple In Harmony, there is no distinction between a list or a tuple. Both are a special case of dictionary. In particular, a list of n values is represented by a dictionary that maps the integers 0, ..., n\u22121 to those values. Hence, if t is a list or tuple, then the notation t[0] returns the first element of the list. You can denote a list by a sequence of values, each value terminated by a comma. As per usual, you can use brackets or parentheses at your discretion. For Python users, the important thing to note is that a singleton list in Harmony must contain a comma. For example [1,] is a list containing the value 1, while [1] is simply the value 1. The list module contains various convenient routines that operate on lists or tuples. Native operations on lists or tuples include the following: t k indexing t + t + ... concatenation t * n n copies of t concatenated v [not] in t check if v is a value in t len t the length of t min t the minimum value in t max t the maximum value in t any t True if any value is True all t True if all values are True t & t & ... pairwise list minimum t | t | ... pairwise list maximum Lists and tuples support comprehension as well. In their most basic form: f(v) for v in s . For example, to check if any element in a list t is even, you can write: any((x%2) == 0 for x in t) . 1.7 String In Harmony, a string is a list of single-character atoms. The Python string notations mostly work in Harmony as well. For example, \u2019abc\u2019 is a three-character string consisting of the atoms .a , .b , and .c . \"abc\" is the same three-character string. Various special characters (including quotes, newlines, etc.) can be escaped using a backslash. Multi-line strings can be terminated by triple quotes or triple double-quotes. Native operations on strings include the following: s k indexing s + s + ... concatenation s * n n copies of s concatenated c[not] in s check if c (a one-character atom) is in s len s the length of s 1.8 Bag or Multiset A bag is represented by a dictionary that maps each element to its multiplicity, for example: { 10:2, 12:1 }. The bag module contains various convenient routines that operate on lists or tuples. Native operations on bags include the following: v[not] in keys b check if v is in b t & t & ... bag intersection t \\| t \\| ... bag union 1.9 Program Counter A program counter is an integer that can be used to index into Harmony bytecode. When you define a method, a lambda function, or a label, you are creating a constant of the program counter type. Operations on program counters include the following: | m a | invoke method with program counter m and argument `a | | atLabel l | return a bag of (method, argument) pairs of threads executing at label l | You can create lambda functions similarly to Python. For example: lambda(x, y): x + y . 1.10 Address In Harmony, each shared variable has an address, which is essentially a list of Harmony values. For example, the address of variable d . v[3] consists of the list .d , .v , and 3 . The only way to construct an address in Harmony is using the ? operator. ?d.v[3] returns the address of variable d.v[3] . An address can be dereferenced to return the value of the variable. If a is an address, then !a returns the value. Like C, Harmony supports the shorthand a->v for the expression (!a).v . 1.11 Context A context value captures the state of a thread. A context is itself composed over various Harmony values. Some of these values can be extracted.

Both tuples and lists map indexes (starting at 0) to Harmony values. Their format is either (e,e, ...,e,) or [e,e, ..., e,] . If the tuple or list has two or more elements, then the final comma is optional. A string is represented as a tuple of its characters. Characters are one-character atoms, which can be expressed in hexadecimal unicode using the syntax .0xXX . A bag or multiset is a dictionary that maps a value to how many times it occurs in the bag. All Harmony values are ordered with respect to one another. First they are ordered by type according to the table above. So, for example, True < 0 < .xyz < { 0 }) . Within types, the following rules apply: False < True ; integers are ordered in the natural way; atoms are lexicographically ordered; program counters are ordered by their integer values; dictionaries are first converted into a list of ordered (key, value) pairs. Then two dictionaries are lexicographically ordered by this representation; a set is first converted into an ordered list, then lexicographically ordered; an address is a list of atoms. None is the empty list of atoms. Addresses are lexicographically ordered accordingly; contexts (Appendix E) are ordered first by name, then by program counter, then by the remaining content.

In its simplest form, { f(v) for v in s } returns a set that is constructed by applying f to all elements in s (where s is a set or a list). This is known as mapping. But set comprehension is much more powerful and can include joining multiple sets (using nested for loops) and filtering (using the where keyword). For example: { x + y for x in s for y in s such that (x * y ) == 4 } returns a set that is constructed by summing pairs of elements from s that, when multiplied, have the value 4 .","title":"1.4 Set"},{"location":"reference/language/value-types/#15-dictionary","text":"A dictionary maps a set of values (known as keys ) to another set of values. The generic syntax of a dictionary is { k 0 : v 0 , k 1 : v 1 , ... }. Different from Python, the empty dictionary is either () or [] (because {} is the empty set in Harmony). If there are duplicate keys in the list, then only the one with the maximum value survives. Therefore the order of the keys in the dictionary does not matter. Dictionaries support comprehension. The basic form is: { f(k) : g(k) fork in s }. There are various special cases of dictionaries, including lists, tuples, strings, and bags (multi-sets) that are individually described below. Operations on dictionaries include the following: d k indexing len d the number of keys in d keys d the set of keys in d v [not] in keys d check if v is a key in d v [not] in d check if v is a value in d min d the minimum value in d max d the maximum value in d any d True if any value is True all d True if all values are True d & d & ... dictionary intersection d \\| d \\| ... dictionary union Because in Harmony brackets are used for parsing purposes only, you can write d[k] (or d(k) ) instead of d k . However, if k is an atom, like .id , then you might prefer the notation k.id . Python users beware: the Harmony v in d operator checks if there is some key k such that d[k] = v . In Python, the same syntax checks if v is a key in d . The difference exists because in Harmony a list is a special case of a dictionary. Dictionary intersection and dictionary union are defined so that they work well with bags. With disjoint dictionaries, intersection and union work as expected. If there is a key in the intersection, then dictionary intersection retains the minimum value while dictionary union retains the maximum value. Unlike Python, Harmony dictionary intersection and union are commutative and associative.","title":"1.5 Dictionary"},{"location":"reference/language/value-types/#16-list-or-tuple","text":"In Harmony, there is no distinction between a list or a tuple. Both are a special case of dictionary. In particular, a list of n values is represented by a dictionary that maps the integers 0, ..., n\u22121 to those values. Hence, if t is a list or tuple, then the notation t[0] returns the first element of the list. You can denote a list by a sequence of values, each value terminated by a comma. As per usual, you can use brackets or parentheses at your discretion. For Python users, the important thing to note is that a singleton list in Harmony must contain a comma. For example [1,] is a list containing the value 1, while [1] is simply the value 1. The list module contains various convenient routines that operate on lists or tuples. Native operations on lists or tuples include the following: t k indexing t + t + ... concatenation t * n n copies of t concatenated v [not] in t check if v is a value in t len t the length of t min t the minimum value in t max t the maximum value in t any t True if any value is True all t True if all values are True t & t & ... pairwise list minimum t | t | ... pairwise list maximum Lists and tuples support comprehension as well.
